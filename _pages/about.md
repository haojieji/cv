I'm a third year Ph.D student from [College of CSEE](https://csee.hnu.edu.cn/), [Hunan University](https://www.hnu.edu.cn/). My research interest includes ***AI-infra Observability***, ***Spatio-Temporal Data Management***, ***Compress Sensing***, ***Network Monitoring***, and ***Time Series Intelligence***.

I am deeply motivated to drive AI infrastructure performance improvements, extending beyond observability.

*Ongoing*: I am applying to the 2025 Tencent Rhino-Bird Infrastructure Technology Research Program with a research proposal titled:
"Evaluating Business Operational Quality via QoS Metrics in Operating Systems".
